I am from Sierra Leone ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡± and I have over three(3) years in program design, project management, and operations across health, education, and entrepreneurship. 
I founded Caring for Girls, a non-profit initiative that has transformed the lives of over 3,000 women and girls in Sierra Leone by delivering vital reproductive health education and services, empowering them to take control of their sexual and reproductive health.

Sinnah has worked with leading organizations such as the International Rescue Committee and has led impactful campaigns and communications strategies at both country and regional levels. Her work bridges global market access, sustainable health solutions, and equitable care delivery.
